                    <div class="bs-docs-section">
                         <h1 id="footer" class="page-header"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-down"></i> Footer &amp; Contact Page</h1>
                         <p>The FLICKR widget settings that appears in the footer can be found in <code>js/restart_theme.js</code></p>
                         <p>The <a href="../contact.html">Contact Page</a> Form works in combination with <a href="../contact.php">contact.php</a> file and contact_form.js. Inside  <a href="../contact.php">contact.php</a> you can find the settings for the form.                         <strong>Of course you have to place the php file to a web server that runs under php 5.2 or newer.</strong></p>
<p>The google map in the contact page uses the <strong>Google Maps Api v3</strong> and it will not work as is. It wil show you the following message:</p>
                         <pre>Google has disabled use of the Maps API for this application.<br>The provided key is not a valid Google API Key, or it is not authorized for the Google Maps<br>Javascript API v3 on this site. If you are the owner of this application,<br>you can learn about obtaining a valid key here:<br>https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial#api_key</pre>
                         <p><strong>So Google tells you that you have to get your own API Key for the map to work</strong>. It is easy and you can follow the directions shown at <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial#api_key">this tutorial</a>. After you get your own API Key, scroll down the code at the bottom of the contact.html  file and follow the instructions. You can even style your map to different colors as shown for example at the <a href="http://snazzymaps.com/">Snazzy Maps</a>!</p>
