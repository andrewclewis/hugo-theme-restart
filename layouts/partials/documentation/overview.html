                         <p>Restart is a multipurpose but mainly<strong> business oriented</strong> HTML5 Template, built to serve as a foundation for your web projects. It is based on <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/"><strong>Twitter Bootstrap (check out BS excellent documentation)</strong></a>, the front-end development framework with a <strong>steep learning curve</strong> that changes the way you develop sites. Restart makes real use of {LESS}. It comes with a <strong><a href="#less">style.less</a></strong> file that tries to use all the power of <strong>{less} and bootstrap combined</strong>. Restart is based on <strong>fine typography</strong> and <strong>large photography</strong>. It uses <strong><a href="#animations">subtle animations</a></strong> & a fresh <strong><a href="#fullpagephoto">collapsing header effect</a></strong>. </p>
